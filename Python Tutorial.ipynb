    "Online I see the question: \"What is the best programming language?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way this question doesn't quite make sense, programming languages serve different roles and have strengths and weaknesses suited for multiple areas. Asking this question is similar to asking, \"Is a hammer the best tool?\" Sure hammers are great, but they don't do a whole lot of good when trying to split a 2x4 in half.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, in this respect, is an execellent general purpose tool for scientists and engineers. Python takes a \"batteries included\" approach to the the language, and aims to make programmers job as easy as possible -- allowing us to think about hard high-leel problems rather than say, memory allocation. Python also has a vast community of individuals from all disciplines, and there are many community developed libraries that increase the robustness of the language. Python itself is an interpreted language meaning we also don't have to deal with compile times, and have a robust interactive mode to test out the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some draw backs in that the canonical CPython implementation is not the fastest language out there, and has problems with multi-threading due to the famous \"Global Interpreter Lock\" or \"GIL.\" Other Python language implementations such as Jython allow for better multi-threading, but still lacks in performance when compared to well optimized C code.\n",
